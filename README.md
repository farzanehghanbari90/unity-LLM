# Kodak LLM-Enhanced Unity Game

A small Unity prototype that uses a large language model (LLM) to drive in-game dialogue, NPC behaviors, and dynamic storytelling. Built on Unity 2024.x and integrated with OpenAI’s GPT-4 API, this project demonstrates how conversational AI can be combined with real-time gameplay.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **LLM-Driven NPCs**  
  NPCs generate context-aware responses on the fly—no more rigid dialogue trees.  
- **Dynamic Quest Generation**  
  Side-quests and hints are created in real time based on player actions and conversation history.  
- **Adaptive Hint System**  
  When the player gets stuck, they can “ask” the game for help; the LLM crafts personalized hints.  
- **Seamless Unity Integration**  
  Uses a lightweight C# wrapper to send prompts to GPT-4 and handle JSON replies.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repo**
